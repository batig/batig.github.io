I’m in the husk of my former apartment, failing to fall asleep on my glorious mattress that’s lying  ungraciously on the floor this time. Said mattress was the most expensive purchase I made after moving here, probably twice as much as the next one, and now it’s on the floor. And it’s quite a filthy floor tbh. That’s because a month ago, when I decided to leave, I also decided that I was only gonna cleanup before I handed the keys to the landlord. Did I mention I have a cat?

Anyway, I’m moving to Stockholm. No, I’m not excited. I kinda loved this apartment. And that’s not all. I’m moving away from all kinds of people I love. So yes, I’m not excited. However, I am intrigued. Turns out that along with a few friends and a job in Stockholm was enough.

September was quite stressful then. Starting a new job after a prolonged break, having to move out of an apartment I love, looking for a pet friendly house in a foreign country. Don’t look quite as scary now, or do they? Hmm.

Enough with that though, the real reason I started writing down the above (:elevator:) is I thought it was hilarious how I will be signing the contract for my next apartment on the day I’m moving from my current one.

Now let’s see what happens.

PS. I might be fixing this place but expect it to take a long time. Like unpacking-and-decorating-your-new-house long. It's only fitting.
